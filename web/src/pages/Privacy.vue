            <p>Your Final Grade (YFG) will only use your data (any information entered into the application and that is generated
                during use directly or indirectly, passively or actively) for improving and debugging the application.
                Class and grade data entered into the application can be deleted either automatically through deleting
                classes individually on the application, or by emailing a request from the associated
                email account to yfg@jcharante.com
                (with an expected response time of 1 week).</p>
            <p>Your class data will never be shared with non-YFG affiliated individuals or companies for any form of
                monetary gain.</p>
            <p>To cover my ass, this policy grants me (the operator of YFG) permission to collect any of your information,
            both possible and impossible, generated during the use or non-use of the Your Final Grade application. This
                ranges from IP addresses used and not used to access YFG to even your own genetic sequence.</p>
            <p>I (the operator of YFG) make no assurances that all of your data isn't stored in plaintext on a publicly accessible server.</p>
            <p>YFG has your email address on file, but you will only receive emails pertaining to account administration
            and product updates. It will not be used for promotional purposes unless you opt in.</p>
            <p>Any change to this privacy policy will require a new confirmation the next time you use the application.
            You will not be emailed when the privacy policy is changed.</p>
            <p>This is version 1, valid as of February 24th 2021, at 8am Eastern Time.</p>
